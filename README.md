## What I Learned

## GraphQL

One of the key takeaways from this project was the use of GraphQL to wrap multiple REST API endpoints. By using GraphQL, we were able to optimize our data fetching by requesting only the specific data we needed, instead of making multiple requests to different endpoints.

With GraphQL, we could define the data schema that our application would use, and make a single request to our server. This single request would retrieve only the data we needed, instead of the multiple requests required when working with REST APIs.

## TypeScript

Another key learning from this project was the use of TypeScript. TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that allows us to write cleaner, more robust code. With TypeScript, we can catch errors during development, and avoid many common bugs that can arise when working with JavaScript.

Using TypeScript allowed us to write code that was more organized, easier to read, and more maintainable. By catching errors during development, we were able to ensure that our code was more reliable, and avoid many of the issues that can arise when working with dynamic languages.

Overall, this project provided a great opportunity to learn about the benefits of GraphQL and TypeScript, and how they can be used together to build more efficient, reliable applications.
